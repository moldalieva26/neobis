JDBC Test
I created a database named furniture_shop and connected through JDBC.
Created a table 'customer'
I added some data into the table, updated and deleted some rows in the table.
I tested through SQL Workbench if the queries were executed right through JDBC 
by creating the same queries through MySQL workbench.
